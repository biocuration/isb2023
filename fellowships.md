The International Society of Biocuration (ISB) is pleased to provide current
members with travel fellowship opportunities. Students, junior curators,
curators from low-income countries, and curators from countries suffering from
natural disasters are encouraged to apply.

Selections will be prioritized by financial need - please note that application
does not guarantee you will receive funding.

## Awards

Each award will be issued as reimbursement for up to â‚¬1,000 per fellowship
depending on the costs of your registration and travel (e.g. hotel, flight, and
ground transportation).

- ISB Travel Fellows must be able to cover their own conference registration
  fees and travel cost before attending the conference. ISB Travel Fellows will
  then submit receipts to request a reimbursement from ISB. Save your receipts!
- The Biocuration Travel Fellowships Committee will advise you on how to receive
  these funds as reimbursement at the end of the conference.
