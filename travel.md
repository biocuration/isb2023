## Applying for an Italian Visa

The [official page](https://vistoperitalia.esteri.it/home/en) from the Italian
Ministry for Foreign Affairs on visa requirements has an interactive page to
help get your visa. You should select _business_ as the reason for entry (not
_research_ nor _study_). You can apply between 6 months and 2 weeks before the
trip, but leaving more time is safer.

See also the [Rights and duties of foreign nationals for entry or short-stay of
up to 90 days in the Schengen Area](https://vistoperitalia.esteri.it/obblighimotivisoggiorno/en/C/2_0_C)
document.
