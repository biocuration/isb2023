The [International Society of Biocuration](https://www.biocuration.org/)'s
Annual Biocuration Conference provides a forum for curators, developers, and
users of clinical and life sciences data, knowledge, and models to discuss their
work, promote collaboration, and foster the community around this active and
growing area of research. Participants from academia, government, and industry
interested in the tools, methodology, and philosophy of curation in the clinical
and life sciences are encouraged to attend and submit an abstract for
consideration for an oral or poster presentation.

Following the virtual installments of the Annual Biocuration Conference in 2021
and 2022 due to the pandemic, we are pleased to announce that the 2023 edition
will return to a fully in-person meeting in Padova, Italy from Monday, April
24th, to Wednesday, April 26th, 2023.
